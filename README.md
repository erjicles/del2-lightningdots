# Lightning Dots

## Overview

This is a simple but deceptively fun free arcade game currently 
available on Android systems. The idea is simple: get as 
many clicks as possible inside the target before time runs 
out. As you progress through the levels, the challenges get 
harder. How far can you get!?

Lightning Dots is currently available in the Google Play Store 
[here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.delsquared.lightningdots).

## Background

I created this game mainly during my free time
as a way to practice my Java skills,
especially multithreading, Android development, real-time
graphics processing, and game development. The graphics are 
purposefully very rudimentary.

## IDE

This app was developed using Android Studio.
